# Burger

## Assignment

Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML. 

"Eat-Da-Burger!" is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
